You make your way to the get-away car once more, this time getting within seeing distance, only to see that the car has been surrounded by poilice officers. It turns out getting that custom DIMND BNDT license plate wasn&#39;t such a good idea. There&#39;s an alley to your left, and a cross-walk to your right.]

Your eyes grow large, but before the panic can really set in, Gary speaks.
&quot;But don&#39;t worry. You were kind to me when no one else was. Go on. I&#39;ll distract them.&quot;]

The officers stop dead in their tracks, utterly dumbfounded. Your hands are moving like lightning, fingertips blazing with the deft skill that can only come from giving up ones career and family to work on a card trick 40 hours a week.
