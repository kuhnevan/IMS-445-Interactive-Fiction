</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="Intro" tags="" position="69,38" size="100,100">You, the infamous Fife-Totin&#39; Diamond Bandit, have just completed your biggest heist yet. Everything has gone according to plan and you&#39;re on your way to the getaway car down the block. You couldn&#39;t have done it more perfectly, except - OH NO! You realize you left your fife at the scene of the crime!
[[Go back for the fife]] 
[[Continue to the get-away car]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Go back for the fife" tags="" position="197,306" size="100,100">That fife is an important part of your identity, so naturally you have to go back for it. There are no police officers in sight. You find it on the ground inside of of the building, just in front of the window. You make your way to the get-away car once more, this time getting within seeing distance, only to see that the car has been surrounded by poilice officers. It turns out getting that custom DIMND BNDT license plate wasn&#39;t such a good idea. There&#39;s an alley to your left, and a cross-walk to your right.
[[Take the alley]]
[[Take the cross-walk]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Continue to the get-away car" tags="" position="611,75" size="100,100">Screw that fife! You&#39;re more than just a fife-totin&#39; bandit, you reassure yourself, as you continue walking to the get-away car. You get in the car, and just as you&#39;re about drive away, three squad cars seal off all means of escape. The infamous Fife-Totin&#39; Diamond Bandit has been caught.
Would you like to try again?
[[Yes-&gt;Intro]]

Your eyes meet, and you peer into this hollow shell of a person.
&quot;Hey! No one steps on Homeless Gary!&quot;, he sputters.
This is a man who has not smiled in a long time...
[[Tickle Homeless Gary]]

No one has tickled him like that in ages! A fire is lit in his once cold, cold heart. Suddenly, his face becomes serious, as his eyes drift first toward the large diamond bulging in your pocket, then to your beautifully hand-crafted fife.
&quot;I&#39;m no fool&quot;, says Homeless Gary. &quot;I know who you are.&quot;
Your eyes grow large, but before the panic can really set in, Gary speaks.
&quot;But don&#39;t worry. You were kind to me when no one else was. Go on. I&#39;ll distract them.&quot;
[[&quot;I&#39;m forever in your debt, Homeless Gary&quot;-&gt;Gary takes action]]

You think to yourself &quot;Well Gary, it&#39;s been a good time. If I had to choose a way to go, this is it.&quot;

Out of the corner of your eye, you notice the police officers have reprimanded the driver and are scouring the area, approaching the alley!

You stand still as the police officers rush by, and pull the Fife-Totin&#39; thief off the fence that their pants have become stuck on. A scuffle ensues, as the officers who caught the thief are not the most physically fit in the bunch...

[[Join the scuffle]]

You notice the diamond has fallen on the ground in the alley, and nobody is noticing!
