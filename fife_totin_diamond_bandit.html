Everything has gone according to plan and you&#39;re on your way to the getaway car down the block. You couldn&#39;t have done it more perfectly, except - OH NO! You realize you left your fife at the scene of the crime!]

There are no police officers in sight. You find it on the ground inside of of the building, just in front of the window. You make your way to the get-away car once more, this time getting within seeing distance, only to see that the car has been surrounded by poilice officers. It turns out getting that custom DIMND BNDT license plate wasn&#39;t such a good idea. There&#39;s an alley to your left, and a cross-walk to your right.]

You get in the car, and just as you&#39;re about drive away, three squad cars seal off all means of escape. The infamous Fife-Totin&#39; Diamond Bandit has been caught.]

Your eyes grow large, but before the panic can really set in, Gary speaks.
